# Go Outside

This project is based on the acronym "GO". Go Outside is an Android app that encourages users to complete various challenges in the great outdoors.

## How to run

This project is run through an emulator on Android Studio.

## Usage

Opening the app takes the user to the main menu. They will see a button that says "GET CHALLENGE". This retrieves an activity from a list, and prompts the user to input if they have completed the challenge. Pressing "YES" takes them back to the home screen, while "NO" asks them if they want to attempt it again.
